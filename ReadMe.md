Project Overview
This project implements a doubly linked list data structure, which allows for storing, adding, and removing elements in a randomized manner. 
The list supports random access to its elements and includes features for both forward and reverse traversal.


File Structure
Node.java: Implements a node for the doubly linked list.
RandomList.java: Implements the randomizable doubly linked list.
ProcessData.java: Defines a structure to store process data.
TestRandomList.java: The test class for demonstrating the functionality of the doubly linked list.
ProcessList1.txt: A sample input file containing process data in the format: processName | value1 | value2 | value3.
